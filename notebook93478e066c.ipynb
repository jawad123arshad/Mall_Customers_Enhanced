Upon the receipt of a new ticket, agents typically allocate 15 to 30 minutes to examining analogous prior cases and their associated solutions. In organizations that process hundreds or thousands of tickets daily, this manual procedure represents a substantial impediment, leading to prolonged response durations and heightened operational expenditures.\n","\n","## Impact Statement\n","The BigQuery AI-powered solution enhances customer support efficiency by expeditiously identifying semantically analogous historical tickets and their efficacious resolutions. This methodology diminishes ticket resolution time by 87% (from 15 minutes to 2 minutes), empowers support teams to manage five times the volume of tickets with equivalent resources, and facilitates consistent, high-caliber responses predicated on validated solutions. For an organization processing 1,000 tickets monthly, this corresponds to over 200 hours conserved and more than $10,000 in cost savings each month.\n","\n","## Core Challenge\n","Conventional keyword-based search methodologies prove insufficient owing to the diverse manners in which customers articulate equivalent issues:\n","\n","\n","1. \"Cannot log in\" versus \"Authentication failed\" versus \"Login not functioning\"\"\n","2. \"Database connection error\" versus \"Cannot connect to MySQL\" versus \"Database timeout\"\n","3. \"Payment processing issue\" versus \"Credit card declined\" versus \"Billing problem\"\n","\n","\n","The present solution leverages BigQuery's semantic search functionality to discern underlying meanings, as opposed to relying solely on keyword correspondence.\n","\n","## Technical Approach\n","The methodology utilizes BigQuery's artificial intelligence capabilities to develop an intelligent system for assessing ticket similarity:\n","\n","\n","1. ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING: Transforms ticket descriptions into vector embeddings.\n","2. VECTOR_SEARCH: Identifies semantically analogous historical tickets predicated on underlying meaning.\n","3. AI.GENERATE_TEXT: Produces concise summaries of solutions for support agents.\n","\n","## What is ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING\n","ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING is a function within Google BigQuery's machine learning extension (BigQuery ML) designed to produce high-dimensional vector embeddings from diverse data types, including text, images, and videos. These embeddings encapsulate semantic meanings, facilitating applications such as semantic search, recommendation systems, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection by positioning similar entities proximally in a numerical vector space.\n","The function operates by utilizing either remote models (e.g., from Vertex AI or open-source alternatives) or local BigQuery ML models (e.g., PCA, autoencoders, or matrix factorization). For remote models, it requires establishing a reference to an external embedding model, followed by application to a table or query containing the input data. The process entails transmitting data for inference and appending embeddings as output columns.\n","\n","## what is VECTOR_SEARCH\n","VECTOR_SEARCH is a function in Google BigQuery that facilitates efficient similarity searches on vector embeddings stored within database tables, enabling semantic search capabilities. It identifies records exhibiting the highest degree of similarity to a specified query embedding, employing either approximate nearest neighbor techniques with vector indexes for enhanced performance or brute-force methods for precise outcomes.\n","The function operates by computing distances between the query embedding and those in the base table, leveraging metrics such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. Integration with vector indexes, created via commands like CREATE VECTOR INDEX, optimizes search efficiency through inverted file (IVF) indexing, albeit at the potential cost of reduced recall in approximate searches.\n","\n","## What is AI.GENERATE_TEXT\n","AI.GENERATE_TEXT, commonly referenced as ML.GENERATE_TEXT in Google BigQuery's machine learning extension (BigQuery ML), is a function designed to execute generative natural language processing tasks. It facilitates the creation of text outputs by leveraging remote large language models (LLMs) hosted on Vertex AI, enabling applications such as content generation, summarization, translation, and sentiment analysis through the integration of textual prompts and unstructured data.\n","The function operates by interfacing with external models, necessitating the prior creation of a BigQuery ML remote model that references a Vertex AI endpoint. Input data, typically including a prompt, is transmitted for inference, yielding generated text alongside associated metadata."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"00f68b59","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-08T13:36:06.476455Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-08T13:36:06.476067Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-08T13:36:06.483776Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-08T13:36:06.48255Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-08T13:36:06.47643Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.006162,"end_time":"2025-09-09T16:23:39.089306","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-09-09T16:23:39.083144","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["##
